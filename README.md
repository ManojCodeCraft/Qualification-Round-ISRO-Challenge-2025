# 🚀 ANAV - Autonomous Navigation Aerial Vehicle (ISRO Challenge 2025 - Qualification Round)

**Team: AetherX**  
**Event: ISRO’s IRoC-U 2025 Challenge**  
**Stage: Qualified the National Level with GPS-Denied Autonomous Drone**

---

## 📖 Project Overview

The **ANAV (Autonomous Navigation Aerial Vehicle)** is a quadrotor drone designed to autonomously take off, hover, and land **without GPS**, tailored for extraterrestrial terrains like **Mars**. This system qualified the **ISRO Challenge 2025 - Qualification Round**, showcasing its capability to operate with precision and safety under constrained environments.

It uses a powerful stack of embedded systems, LiDAR sensors, optical flow, and computer vision—all controlled by **Raspberry Pi 5** and **CubePilot Orange**.

## 🚀 Mission Logic (Autonomous Mode)

1. 🟢 **Start & Init** – System boots, calibrates sensors, and links RPi5 ↔ CubePilot
2. 🛫 **Takeoff** – Ascend to 3–10 meters using LiDAR + IMU + Optical Flow
3. ✈️ **Hover** – Maintain altitude and position for 30 seconds
4. 🛬 **Landing** – Controlled descent to initial position (within 1.2×1.2 m)
5. 🛡️ **Failsafe** – Auto-landing on battery drop, signal loss, or instability

---

## 🔍 Emergency Response System (ERS)

ANAV incorporates both **hardware-level** and **software-level** safety mechanisms:

- Manual Kill Switch (via GCS or RC)
- Battery Voltage Monitoring (`battery_monitor.py`)
- Link-Loss Handling (heartbeat timeout triggers auto-land)
- Geofence violation detection and correction
- Logging using `rosbag` for post-mission diagnostics

## 🧪 Tests Conducted

| Test | Description | Outcome |
|------|-------------|---------|
| 🛠️ Thrust Calibration | Motor sync and ESC tuning | ✅ Resolved yaw instability |
| 🛰️ Altitude Hold | Hovering at 3m using LiDAR + Optical Flow | ✅ Stable hover achieved |
| ✈️ Autonomous Flight | Single-command auto takeoff → hover → land | ✅ Successful 30s hover + smooth landing |
| 💥 Emergency Protocol | Link loss, battery drop, manual abort | ✅ Auto-landing triggered safely |
